What Are Claims?
Claims are pieces of information about a user that tell a system who they are and what they can do. Think of claims as small notes attached to a user that say things like:

"This user is named Alice."
"Alice is an admin."
"Alice's email is alice@example.com."
Example Scenario
Imagine you have a website where users can log in to access different features.

User Logs In: When Alice logs in, the system creates a token (like a digital ID card) for her. This token contains claims about her.

Claims in the Token:

Name: "Alice"
Email: "alice@example.com"
Role: "Admin" (meaning she has special privileges)
Using Claims:

When Alice tries to access an admin dashboard, the system checks her token.
It looks at the claims: since her role is "Admin," the system lets her in.
If another user, Bob, logs in as a regular user (with a role claim of "User"), he won't be able to access the admin dashboard.
